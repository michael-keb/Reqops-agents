"""Abstract base class for SandboxSession — one per running compute.

Concrete provider classes (DaytonaSandboxSession, DockerSandboxSession,
UnixLocalSandboxSession, ModalSandboxSession) implement the 5 lifecycle
methods.

Decision: ``stop()`` and ``shutdown()`` are split. ``stop()`` is the
data-preserving operation (snapshot + pause compute). ``shutdown()`` is
the in-memory cleanup (cancel tasks, drop subscribers). The pool calls
both in sequence on graceful release; a truly-dead session gets only
``shutdown()``.
