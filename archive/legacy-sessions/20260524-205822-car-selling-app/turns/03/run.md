TURN 3

Apply the rubric in the system message. User input is source of truth; recompute codes each turn.
Enabled output sections: state_codes, questions

--- OUTPUT FORMAT (this turn) ---
Respond using only the section(s) enabled below — omit disabled sections entirely.


## State codes
A single fenced-less line of codes, e.g.:
P3 G1:X1 G4:X2 G6:X1 G8:X1 L1 L4 R3 S2 Q1 Q7


## Questions
Exactly 3 multiple-choice questions when phase is P3 (elicitation).
For P1/P2/P4: write "_(no MCQs this turn — phase gate)_" and explain the next step instead.

Each MCQ must include:
- A short title with the driving gap code, e.g. **G6 — scope boundary**
- The question (S3: one decision each)
- Options A–D where D is always "Something else" (S4)
- At least one safe/conservative option (S2)
- One question must be your Q7 open probe (not purely G-derived)

Format each MCQ like:

### 1. G6 — scope boundary
[question]
- A) ...
- B) ...
- C) ...
- D) Something else — [hint for sub-angle]
